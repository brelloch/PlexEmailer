# PlexEmailer
A quick project to email the latest additions to plex so my family can stop complaining they don't know what has been added.

Only tested with gmail for sending emails.

Usage:
PlexEmailer.exe -e |comma separated list of emails to send to| -u |http://localhost:32400/| -t |plex token| -f |from email address| -p |from email password|
